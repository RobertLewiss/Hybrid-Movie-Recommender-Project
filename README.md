# Movie Recommender System
 Project on Recommender Systems - Implementing a Hybrid recommender 

This project Explores various Movie recommender system methods, with the main aim to build a fully hybrid NN recommender.

Methods include: Content based methods (TF-IDF Vectors, word embeddings), Collaborative filtering methods (models and memory based) and Hybrid methods.


Contents:
 - Hybrid_Recommender_System.ipynb: This is the Main Notebook where I go through each Recommender method and evaluate each.
 - PreProcessing.ipynb: This notebook goes through the necessary preprocessing methods to clean the Movie data.
 - Utils.py: These are Functions I created for the Hybrid_Recommender_System.ipynb, it includes the code for each algorithm and evaluation functions. It also has some visualisation and plotting functions.
 - RecEDA.ipynb: Messy notebook where I explored some recommender systems.
